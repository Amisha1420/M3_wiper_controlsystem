Introduction:This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all types of vehicles the main purpose is to clean the rain air drops present in front screen of the vehicles. It is very difficult to drive the vehicles in rain condition so in this case we will use wipers to clean the front screen of vehicles which is mirror so that we can drive the vehicles even in rainly season.
Aim: To prevent the Accidents During rainly condition.
Features: 1.It shall lock the car when button is pressed ONCE.                                                                                                                   2.It shall open the car when button is pressed TWICE.                                                                                                                   3.It shall wiper on and it moves clock wise direction when button is pressed THREE times.                                                                               4.It shall wiper off and it moves anti clock wise direction when button is pressed FOUR times.                                                                         5.It shall wiper complete one cycle when the button is pressed FIVE times.

We can control the wiper speed using just one button.                                                            4.Windscreen wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver's visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles.   2.Weakness:- 1.Increased Replacement Costs Rubber Blades are required.                                                                                                              2. Wiper motor problems A build up of snow or ice can cause problems like bent wiper blades, wiper arms that skip, or a blown fuse and other issues with              the wiper motor.                                                                                                                                          3.Opportunities:-1.Safety and Healthy well being opportunities                                                                                                                          2.Emoloyment Opportunities.                                                                                                                                            3.Increase as wiper system is necessary to install.                                                                                                4.Threats :-1.Snow removal hard blades technology is available.                                                                                                                     2.Replaced by Advance Technology.
Research :- Application is researched from various resources like from Google, YouTube and from Research Papers and then developed one application model called as wiper control system.
End Goal :-1.Avoid Accidents and Provide safety environment.                                                                                                                      2. clear vision in wheather condition.
